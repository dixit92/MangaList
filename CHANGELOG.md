# Changelog

Versions are calendar versions `YEAR.MONTH.N`: the release's year and month plus a counter that
restarts each month (`2026.9.0`, `2026.9.1`, `2026.10.0`). To release: rename `[Unreleased]` to
`[YEAR.MONTH.N] - YYYY-MM-DD`, start a new empty `[Unreleased]`, commit, then tag `vYEAR.MONTH.N` and
push the tag. CI refuses a tag without its section here and uses the section as the release notes.

## [Unreleased]

First packaged release.

- MangaUpdates matching uses a port of MangaPixer's matcher (1.26.1): it first decides whether a
  folder is one work, searches several title variants, and sorts results into *auto*, *needs
  review* (orange, with reasons) and *unmatched*. Numbered chapters with chapter subtitles count as
  one series; author names in brackets help pick between same-titled records.
- Matches cached by earlier versions keep their old score, marked as legacy; **Check MU** re-matches
  them. Confirmed matches are never re-scored.
- Settings, cache and logs moved to a per-user folder; the old `data` folder next to the program is
  copied over once on first start. The portable Windows zip keeps its data next to the exe.
- Packages for Windows (installer and portable zip), macOS (Apple silicon and Intel) and Linux
  (AppImage and tar.gz), with `SHA256SUMS`.
- `--version` and `--smoke-test` command-line options.
